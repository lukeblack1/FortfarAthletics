<b>Raith Rovers will face Queen of the South in the Scottish Championship Play-off final after edging out 10-man Forfar Athletic on aggregate.</b>



<p>
It looked like former Rovers striker John Baird might come back to haunt the Kirkcaldy side when his header levelled the tie after the break.
</p><p>
But Kevin Nisbet, who scored in Rovers' 2-1 first-leg win, replied from the penalty spot four minutes later.
</p>
Michael Travis was sent off for the foul on Nathan Ferguson.

<p>Nisbet and James Gullan spurned good chances as Rovers tried to make their numerical advantage count to kill off the tie.</p>

<p>
However, the 1-1 draw was enough for the Kirkcaldy side to move within two matches of returning to the Championship after a two-year absence.
</p>
<p>
Forfar are now 11 games unbeaten at home, but their failure to make it a 10th win during that run means they will remain in League One for another season.
