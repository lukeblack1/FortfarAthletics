At the close of yesterday’s local derby Supporters' Club Chair Person Rhona Shepherd and long-serving treasurer David Strachan presented Chairman Ross Graham with a cheque for £20,000 as a result in the main of their match day activities on the club’s behalf including the organising of the 50/50 draw and of course the staffing of the ever welcoming Refreshment Kiosk.

The efforts of sadly an ever dwindling few on the Supporters' Club committee are very much appreciated by all concerned at Station Park, the monies raised over a many year a great and always welcome boost to club funds.
